# Simple Applicant Tracking Systems Application

Technologies used in project:
- React,
- Apache TomEE JAX-RS,
- PostgreSQL database.

# About application

Simple application used for applicantâ€™s management. This application consists of 2 main views. When you first open application,
you see list of applicants with some personal data: applicants photo, first name and last name, place of employment and address.
Search through list of applicants is possible by inputting some text in search box and pressing enter, free text search. Search
is case insensitive and applies to all personal data of applicant (first name, last name, address and place of employment).
By clicking on one of listed applicants, second view appears. This view contains original list of applicants, same as in first
view, followed by experience and education data for clicked applicant and chat. Chat contains messages that are exchanged between
applicant and admin user. If you perform search for applicants from this view, you are returned to main (first) view again,
displaying list of applicants that satisfy search criteria. Returning to main view is also possible by clicking on DCCS logo,
in which case list contains all applicants. Another important aspect of applications is routing. If you do refresh of application
after you clicked some applicant, you still get to see same view. Besides personal data in applicants list, you have option to
delete or edit applicant. Click on delete button delete selected applicant from the list, click on edit button opens edit pop-up.
Edit pop-up contains three parts: first for editing personal data about applicant, second for adding new experiences, and third
part for adding new education to applicant.

# How to run?

Download or clone project from my git repository, import as maven project into your working environment, set-up postgeSQL database.
Details about database set-up are in posgreSQL directory. Once you set-up your database you are ready to run app with command:
'mvn clean install tomee:run' from root application folder (~/applicant-tracking-systems) and then run: 'npm start' from react-app
directory (~/applicant-tracking-systems/react-app), application will open in your web browser on address: 'http://localhost:3000/'.

# Code architecture

Server serves client with data from database (read, insert, update, delete). Server is implemented in JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services),
client is implemented in React and database is PostgreSQL. Client send request to server, server connects to database and depends on request
method (GET, POST, DELETE) execute corresponding sql statement. Server return response to client with corresponding data, client then present
data to user and that is most simplified explanation on how this architecture works.
Code of server implementation is in src/main/java folder, package org.superbiz. It consist of Applicant, Education, Experience, Message, CorsFilter
and ApplicantService java classes. Main functionality of the server is contained in class ApplicantService, more details of how it works you can read
from code comments. Client implementation is in React and is contained in react-app/src directory. Inside src directory there are two folders:
png (contains photos of admin, DCCS logo and education), style (contains css files for each JS file), and JS files written in React (ApplicantApp,
ApplicantInfo, ChatInfo, EditForm, EducationForm, ExpEduInfo, ExperienceForm, SearchBar and index). If you want to understand code architecture
more deeply you should start reading code comments from index.js, follow comment leads and read the rest of comments in others JS file.
